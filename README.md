# Clash royale deck sniper

Here's what it does:
- You enter a battle, and quickly enter the opponent's name and clan.
- It will then (if succesful) show you their deck, and you potentially have an advantage if you can make assumptions early on in the match.
- I have won a few matches by predicting the opponent's moves with this.

How to use:
- Download the sniper.zip from the latest release, and then extract it to find an .exe file.
- When you first run it, it will ask you for an api key.
- To get an api key for free, go to the official clash royale api website https://developer.clashroyale.com/ and make an account.
- Then, go to my account -> My keys and create a new key. 
- Name it anything, add any description, and then add this ip address (because of royaleapi proxy) - `45.79.218.79`
- Then go back and copy the token, and enter it when prompted.
- Alternatively, edit the token in the `key.txt` file saved in the same folder.
- Enter the name and clan, and it should show you their deck.

Notes:
- sometimes it gets the wrong player, because theres a lot of clans with that name
- this basically does the same thing as going to clan search, and finding a player from there in-game, but much faster.
